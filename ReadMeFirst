Hello, You are reading something like license. I have something you need to know.

Frist, ParadOS is a open source project, you can read my code, modify it, compile it, and use it.

Second, You can also consult my code in other project, but you must write down where did the code reference came from in your code file.

Fourth, After you done something in your fork that might help ParadOS (A line of code, An idea, A Logo..blah blah blah) i hope you can give me a pull request, and let others have a chance to learn or discuss about it.

Third, You cant distribute ParadOS for any commercial purposes. I dont want to see someone are selling ParadOS or its sub-version.

Final, Open Source is good, but dont be a cunt.
