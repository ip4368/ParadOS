# ParadOS

### What is the purpose of ParadOS?
Want to write a  modular os, that the people can decide what the os look like, and also keep the compatibility.
Like the LEGO, assemble parts together and just work fine.
### Target platform: 
X86_64 and Arm(Maybe RPI?)
### TODO(long term):
* A shell using special SQL language.
* Provide simple system call.
* Write an file system.
* Define a new executable structure.
* Arduino Firmata
* more
 
thank you!
